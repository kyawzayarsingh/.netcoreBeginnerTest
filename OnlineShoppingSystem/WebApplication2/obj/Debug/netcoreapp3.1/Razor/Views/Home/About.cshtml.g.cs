<p>
    Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller 
    over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of 
    the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same 
    product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of 
    different computers and devices,including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.
    An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular ""bricks-and-mortar"" retailer or
    shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to 
    enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called ");
            WriteLiteral(@"business-to-business (B2B) online shopping. 
    A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images
    of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices.
    Online stores usually enable shoppers to use ""search"" features to find specific models, brands or items. Online 
    customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a
    credit card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books
    or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital audio files of 
    songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online 
    retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay
